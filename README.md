# VulcanaGames_Bomblob

2023 

This is a Gamejam, done during three weeks with a group of three (Paula, Ewa and me) in Unity.

[You can play it here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.VulcanGames.icebomb&hl=de) 

I am the main programmer in that project. The gamejam is done.  

# Gameplay 
The game is a mobile game. 
- It has functions to drag and drop ice cream blob creatures.
- Four different types of food is falling down
- the ice cream can eat the food to get a solid ice block
- the goal is, to build as high as you can
- if you feed a colored ice cream with the wrong food, it will explode (and pushes the building away)
- you can get score if you feed the ice cream
- the highscore will be saved
- the design of the blobs is generated randomized
